## Rock-Paper Scissors

This is a project I'm very proud of. It's my first "own" project, which I made without help, tutorials or similar.

You are the "Player" and your opponent ist the computer. You have to choose Rock, Paper or Scissors and the computer chooses for himself.

The winner is who got the most points out of five rounds, a draw is also possible.

### Tech used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

### To-Do

_Things I want to improve in the future_

1. Make the code cleaner.
1. Implement an other "win screen", since an alert doesn't look good.
1. Add a possibility where the player can choose how many rounds he wants to play.
