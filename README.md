# Rock-Paper Scissors

This is a project I'm very proud of. It's my first "own" project, which I made without help, tutorials or similar.

You are the "Player" and your opponent ist the computer. You have to choose Rock, Paper or Scissors and the computer chooses for himself.

Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beats rock.

The winner is who got the most points out of five rounds, a draw is also possible.
