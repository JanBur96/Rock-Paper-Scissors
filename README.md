## Rock-Paper Scissors

This is a project I'm very proud of. It's my first "own" project, which I made without help, tutorials or similar.

### Tech used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

### To-Do

_Things I want to improve in the future_

1. Make the code cleaner.
1. Implement an other "win screen", since an alert doesn't look good.
1. Add a possibility where the player can choose how many rounds he wants to play.

#### What did the project bring me?

* It improved my problem solving skills and helped me to think more complex.
* It helped me to practice DOM Manipulation.
